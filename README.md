## Study 1

> **Source:** *Pure Pursuit Path Tracking for Autonomous Vehicles*, Section 4.1  
>
> **4.1. Effects of Changing the Lookahead Distance**  
> There is one parameter in the pure pursuit algorithm, the lookahead distance. The effects of changing the lookahead distance must be considered within the context of one of two problems:  
>
> 1) Regaining a path; i.e. the vehicle is a “large” distance from the path and must attain the path.  
> 2) Maintaining the path, i.e. the vehicle is on the path and wants to remain on the path.  
>
> The effects of changing the parameter in the first problem are easy to imagine using the analogy to human driving. **Longer lookahead distances tend to converge to the path more gradually and with less oscillation**. The response of the pure pursuit tracker looks similar to the step response of a second order dynamic system (Figure 2.), and the value of L tends to act as a damping factor.
